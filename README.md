# Statistical-mechanics-of-networks

The purpose of this repository is to recover the reciprocity and connectance of the model of Holland and Leinhardt
that appears in Fig 1 of the article "Statistical mechanics of networks" by Juyong Park and M.E.J. Newman. 
This was an assignment during my master at EPFL.
